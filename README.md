Titanic Data Visualization

## Data Sources
All of the Titanic datasets vary slightly.  In this dataset, our working numbers are 703 survivors out of 2169 total onboard.  

We include the musicians as "crew".  Passengers younger than one year are labeled as age 1.  We don't include passengers/crew who disembarked at Cherbourg.  Passengers who died shortly after rescue are still considered to be "survivors" because they were alive at the time of rescue.
